    <h2 id="history"> > HOW INTERNET BEGIN ..?</h2>
    <p> before todays version of the internet which you can talk to the girls and share your photos with dog face, the main porpose of the internet was to link and share between computers around the worled like on<span> October 29,
			1969</span> when The ARPANET (later renamed the internet) established a successful link between the University of California Los Angeles and the Stanford Research Institute
        <br>and in <span>1970</span>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol) established, allowing internet technology to mature. The development of these protocols aided in the standardization of how data was sent and received via
        the internet. </p>
    <p>
        <span>in 1986</span>"__NSFNET__", the 56 Kbps backbone of the internet, was financed by the National Science Foundation in 1986. Because government monies were being used to administer and maintain it, there were commercial restrictions in place
        at the time.

    </p>
    <p>
        <span>in 1991</span>a user-friendly internet interface was developed. Delphi was the first national commercial online service to offer internet connectivity </p>
    <p><span>in May 1995</span>All restrictions on commercial usage of the internet are lifted. As a result, the internet has been able to diversify and grow swiftly. Wi-Fi was first introduced
        <span>in 1997</span></p>

    <p>I know you do not like history too much...but It was important to mention<br>so lets go to the main thing ...</p>
    <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h2 id="working"> > Working of the internet..</h2>
    <p>The internet is a global computer network that connects various devices and sends a lot of information and media. It uses an
        <abber title="internet protocol">
            <span style="cursor:help;">(__IP__) </span>
        </abber>and
        <abber title="Transport Control Protocol">
            <span style="cursor:help;">(__TCP__) </span>
        </abber> -based packet routing network. TCP and IP work together to ensure that data transmission across the internet is consistent and dependable, regardless of the device or location. Data is delivered across the internet in the form of messages
        and packets. A message is a piece of data delivered over the internet, but before it is sent, it is broken down into smaller pieces known as packets. </p>
    <!------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------>>
    <h2 id="protocols">> Internet Protocols....</h2>
    <p>imagine that you are living in isolate place where there is no internet amd you mailing your crush on the other land of the world,
        <br>On the envelope, addresses are written in the following order: name, street address, city, state, and zip code. If an envelope is dropped into a mailbox with the zip code written first, followed by the street address, followed by the state,
        and so on, the post office won't deliver it. There is an agreed-upon protocol for writing addresses in order for the postal system to work. In the same way, all IP data packets must present certain information in a certain order, and all IP addresses
        follow a standardized format.

        <br>so the simplest ways to define protocols is "is a standardized way of doing certain actions and formatting data so that two or more devices are able to communicate with and understand each other."</p>

    <!----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->
    <h2 id="packets">Packets (TCP/UDP)..?</h2>
    <p>The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport protocol, meaning it dictates the way data is sent and received. A TCP header is included in the data portion of each packet that uses TCP/IP. Before transmitting data, TCP opens a connection
        with the recipient. TCP ensures that all packets arrive in order once transmission begins. Via TCP, the recipient will acknowledge receiving each packet that arrives. Missing packets will be sent again if receipt is not acknowledged.
        <hr>The User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, is another widely used transport protocol. It's faster than TCP, but it is also less reliable. UDP does not make sure all packets are delivered and in order, and it doesn't establish a connection before beginning
        or receiving transmissions.
