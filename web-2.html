    <h2 id=" ip "> > IP protocol....?</h2>
    <p>An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to a device or domain that connects to the Internet. Each IP address is a series of characters, such as <span>192.168.1.1'</span>'. Via
        <abber title="Domain Name System "><span style="cursor:help; ">DNS </span></abber>resolvers, which translate human-readable domain names into IP addresses, users are able to access websites without memorizing this complex series of characters. Each IP packet will contain both the
        IP address of the device or domain sending the packet and the IP address of the intended recipient, much like how both the destination address and the return address are included on a piece of mail.</p>
    <img src="assests/internet_protocol_ip_address_diagram.svg ">
    <h2 id="dns "> > DNS..?</h2>
    <p> The Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet. Humans access information online through domain names, like nytimes.com or espn.com. Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses
        so browsers can load Internet resources.
        <br>The process of DNS resolution involves converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1). An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find
        the appropriate Internet device - like a street address is used to find a particular home. When a user wants to load a webpage, a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser (example.com) and the machine-friendly address
        necessary to locate the example.com webpage.

    <h2 id="http "> > HTTP..?</h2>
    <p>Now after I explain the details ,<br>you might be familyer with <span> Http</span> <img src="assests/http.png "> you see it every where on internet but do ask....what is that mean??
        <br>Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as
        <abber title="Hyper text markup lang. ">
            <span style="cursor: help; ">(__HTML__)</span></abber> . It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes. HTTP follows a classical client-server model, with a client opening
        a connection to make a request, then waiting until it receives a response. HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning that the server does not keep any data (state) between two requests.</p>
    <h2 id="html "> > HTML</h2>
    <p>stands for "HYPER TEXT MARKUP LANGUAGE " it is the sturcture of web page<br>"Hypertext " refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. Links are a fundamental aspect of the Web. By uploading
        content to the Internet and linking it to pages created by other people, you become an active participant in the World Wide Web.</p>
